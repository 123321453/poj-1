 * Paths on a Grid Time Limit: 1000MS	Memory Limit: 30000K Total Submissions:
 * 18572	Accepted: 4470 Description
 *
 * Imagine you are attending your math lesson at school. Once again, you are
 * bored because your teacher tells things that you already mastered years ago
 * (this time he's explaining that (a+b)2=a2+2ab+b2). So you decide to waste
 * your time with drawing modern art instead.  *
 * Fortunately you have a piece of squared paper and you choose a rectangle of
 * size n*m on the paper. Let's call this rectangle together with the lines it
 * contains a grid. Starting at the lower left corner of the grid, you move your
 * pencil to the upper right corner, taking care that it stays on the lines and
 * moves only to the right or up. The result is shown on the left:  *
 *
 * Really a masterpiece, isn't it? Repeating the procedure one more time, you
 * arrive with the picture shown on the right. Now you wonder: how many
 * different works of art can you produce? Input
 *
 * The input contains several testcases. Each is specified by two unsigned
 * 32-bit integers n and m, denoting the size of the rectangle. As you can
 * observe, the number of lines of the corresponding grid is one more in each
 * dimension. Input is terminated by n=m=0. Output
 *
 * For each test case output on a line the number of different art works that
 * can be generated using the procedure described above. That is, how many paths
 * are there on a grid where each step of the path consists of moving one unit
 * to the right or one unit up? You may safely assume that this number fits into
 * a 32-bit unsigned integer. Sample Input
 *
 * 5 4
 * 1 1
 * 0 0
 * Sample Output
 *
 * 126 2 Source
